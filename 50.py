      a) Rad 10 character at a time and then print(its current position of file object. Repeat this operation till the EOF.
        b) Reset the file pointer after reading 100 Character from file ( Use Seek function to reset)
        c) Open the file in read mode and start printing the contents from 5th line onwards.
